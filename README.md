# About the Project
A book review web app built with .NET Core and React (TypeScript).

The backend includes base repository and base controller implemented using generics to simplify API extensibility and promote code reuse (particularly useful for partial update and constrained GET endpoints). It also features a CustomExceptionHandler using ProblemDetails to provide consistent and standardized API error responses. The frontend features custom components and responsive UI styled primarily with Tailwind CSS, and React Query for caching. Testing is covered with NUnit for backend API endpoints (component/integration tests) and Playwright for frontend behavior and end-to-end coverage.

Below are some example pages highlighting key features of the application:
